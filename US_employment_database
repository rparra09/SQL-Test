--Q2.1: What was the total employment in 'Mining and Logging' in each division in June 2019?
-- List the division names (alphabetically) with the corresponding region name, show the total employment
-- rounded to an integer number, and show the record count for each row. The first row should show: East North Central, Midwest, 38, 5
--names	region	employment	record_count

SELECT division.name as names, region, ROUND(SUM(employment_1000s::numeric),0) as employment, COUNT(*) as record_count
